In this test we were testing 2 functionality of the code, we need to focus on test 1 only one thing in each test, thats why I split them into to test, adding them a descriptive name



###Test 2

In this test occurs the same thing that in test #1, I split them into 2 test cases, and one should receive an exception, so, we dont need a try catch, also, removed the assertEquals and replaced with assertThrows.



###Test 3

In this test case we had no opportunity to test the method adjustsToScreenSize, because were initialized on 1024, so we dont know if it works propperly, i use a variable named width, and initialized the component with a width of 10, after that i use the method adjustsToScreenSize and instead of using assertTrue, im using assertEquals, comparing the initial variable witdh to the widht of the component.
